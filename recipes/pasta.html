            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>I decided to include this dish because it reminds me of my childhood-my mother would be making pasta and she'd let me steal some plain noodles to eat alone or with butter.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In a medium-sized pot, boil water and salt it. Add your pasta, and cook according to the package instructions. When the pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta</li>
                <li>To make the garlic butter sauce for pasta: In a skillet, melt butter on medium heat and saute the sliced garlic very lightly. Add the hot pasta along with a part of the pasta water, and toss it using kitchen tongs until a sort of thick sauce is coating the pasta. Keep on tossing and add more pasta water if needed.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat, and add freshly grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley leaves. Toss continuously and season with salt if needed. Serve warm with extra grated parmesan cheese and enjoy!</li>
